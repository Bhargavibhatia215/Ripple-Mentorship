# Ripple-Mentorship 1.0

This is the repository that contains all the material/code that you will produce during mentorship programme. A few points of administration:

1. The length of the mentorship is around 4 weeks.

2. For any help with the course, you can contact your mentor. 

3. All your code will be pushed to GitHub, so if you haven't already, create a GitHub account. *Fork and clone this repository and create your respective folders.*

**(Follow this tutorial to create pull request after adding files to your fork) -> https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github **

4. Add every question with name of the file as `Day_1_<Problem-name>.cpp` (If you code in C++) under your name directory.

Don't be afraid to ask any questions (however irrelevant you think it may be). The mentors are here to help you every step of the way.
